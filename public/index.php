                <p>Welcome to the Dev with a Beard's site. The Bearded Dev is a website development company
                    designed to help bring your website to life. If you can dream it, we can build it. Remember,
                    if you don't find what you're looking for, feel free to ask me what I can do for you.</p>
                <p>
                    Throughout this site you'll see parallax, the site's responsiveness, and if you're good, you'll
                    find an Easter Egg (hint: it's on the Contact page). I've utilized Javascript to check that
                    certain requirements were met on the Contact Form as well as PHP to style out the email that I
                    receive when you fill out and send your information via my contact form.

            <div class="white-box lato-p">
                <p>The Bearded Dev started learning code a little over a decade ago. He began writing code
                    for a computer based video game which included creating multi-player and co-op maps. The program
                    he used provided the graphic parts such as the buildings and AI, but he created the story line as well
                    as programming the AI on what to do, how well to do it, and where to do it at.</p><br>
                <p>The Bearded Dev has since then created programs that helped automate the sending of alert emails
                    when monitoring software encountered an error with a server or application. He's created colorful
                    sites and is constantly looking for new and cool ways to make this site different from the rest of the
                    world. He is a busy developer as he is also pursuing his MBA at this time, but is able to also work on
                    websites and other programs.</p>
