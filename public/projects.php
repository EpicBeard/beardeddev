        <p class="robot">Aegis Shield<sup>&reg;</sup> Mobile is an application for both iOS and Android. I helped
            create this application for iPhone as well as making minor contributions to the Android version. The application
            is offered under a subscription to entities such as NCAA, WWE, NASCAR, MLB, and many other programs. The application
            has a scan function that scans the UPC code and checks the Aegis database to see if the supplement is allowed in that
            program. It can also inform you about over the counter medications and prescription medications as well. Simply
            click or touch the title for this excerpt and visit the app in the store.</p>

        <h2 class="orbitron-h2">Eye Jai</h2><br>
        <p class="robot">Eye Jai was another mobile application built while at Darkstar Digital. The pretense was for a
            user to have a store account where they could showcase and or sell their products. It was for this application that
            I created an algorithm that would allow the chat bubbles to grow exponentially with a large and undetermined amount
            of text. This was also used in the Android version as well. The application was to be deployed to a country in Southeast
            Asia.</p>

        <h2 class="orbitron-h2"><a href="http://corrconsultgroup.com/index.php" target="_blank">Correctional Consulting Services Group, Inc.</a></h2><br>
        <p class="robot">Correctional Consulting Services Group was the first website I ever built without a template and very little guidance.
            I worked on a navigation bar with some extra style to it. I also implemented some Javascript that allowed a user to select a topic from
            a long list of titles and be able to read the story of that title. The amount of accomplishments that Correctional Consulting Services Group
            has obtained during it's time are quite numerous. This allowed the site to have the entire list with a clean approach to telling the stories.
            Select the title for Correctional Consulting to visit their site and check out the Projects tab on the navigation bar.</p>

        <h2 class="orbitron-h2"><a href="http://hartfordtitleva.com/" target="_blank">Hartford Title</a></h2><br>
        <p class="robot">Hartford Title LLC was the first site I created that was responsive and created from scratch. I also created
            a contact form that sends the company an email, that is styled using PHP, when potential client visits their site. There's also a Google map at the
            bottom of the contact page showing their location (that was actually easy thanks to Google).</p>

        <p class="robot">911 Target and Medical Concepts was already a live site. The owner needed a few items touched up
            and I was able to help him fix his issues in a very short amount of time. As of now, this is a completed site but it could
            change in the near future.</p>

        <p class="robot">The Bearded Dev is the site I've built for my business. It's still under creation, but the pages
            that are up are functioning as well as responsive. I've used no templates in the making of this site. The contact
            form is functioning using Javascript to check for the required fields and a php file that formats and styles the email with
            the information before it goes out. </p>
