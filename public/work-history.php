            <p>As the resident Scrum Master at Darkstar Digital, I conducted sprint planning, followed up on clarification of requirements for product
                backlog, grooming, retrospectives, and burndowns to improve efficiency in product rollouts.</p>
            <p>I also helped create the internal documentation to reference the Agile methodologies and the submission
                process for iOS Apps to the Apple App Store.</p>
            <p>Collaborating with the production team, I helped create a scanning function for Aegis Shield Mobile for
                iOS where a UPC coding system would provide a nutrient breakdown on products for athletes that proved
                instrumental for meeting physical fitness requirements.</p>
            <p>I was able to contribute to the Android version of EyeJai by creating an algorithm that enabled the entry
                of an exponential amount of text.</p>
            <p>Following Agile methodology, I helped conduct weekly analysis of projects, reviewing gaps, to promote process
                improvement; reviewed code, performed manual testing and ensured that project schedules were on track.</p><hr style="color: black; width: 1em;"><br>

                <p>As an integral member of the Critical Response Team for Asurion in the ATOC, I created an automation tool to perform comprehensive monitoring of Spectrum
                    (industry specific software) to alert the help desk team of issues, prioritize issues and facilitate expedited issue resolution.</p>
                <p>I led emergency cross functional conferences that resolved technical issues and mitigated international
                    customer downtimes and service interruptions.</p>
                <p>I helped manage deployments for over 25 development teams across multiple environments prioritizing
                    deployment items appointing values based on urgency and technical dependencies.</p>
                <p>I also performed comprehensive analysis of historical incidents to improve incident management turnaround times.</p>
                <p>I also provided guidance for proper protocol application within the IIS Windows and Linux environments.</p>
